Chapter 08: Language

In this chapter we will discuss the differences between language and math that make language algorithms difficult.

We will then build a space insertion algorithm that can take any text in any language and insert spacees wherever they are missing.

After that we will build a phase completion algorithm that can imitate the style of a writer and find the most fitting next word in a phrase.


We will be relying on two new tools:

    1. List Comprehensions: enable us to quickly generate lists using  the logic of loops and iterations.
    2. Corpus: A body of text that will "teach" our algorithm the language and style we want it to use.
